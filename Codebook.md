###Information about the summary choices made:

1. The X_test, subject_test and Y_test data was combined
2. Similarly X_train, subject_train and Y_train data was combined
3. The two sets produced in 1 and 2 where combined
4. Selected the set of columns that depict mean and standard deviation
5. Enriched activity so that the alpha numeric description is used
6. Made the column descriptions human readable by expanding abbreviations
7. Produced the mean of all remaining variables grouped by activity and subject
8. Wrote the output out to a txt file
